## LOTR Companions


LOTR Companions is a work-in-progress Forge Minecraft Mod inspired by and with some code borrowed from the Human Companions mod in order to re-implement hire-able units back into the Lord of the Rings: Renewed Mod.

This means that it is written for Minecraft 1.16.5 and will match the version of the LOTR: Renewed mod.

Also since it uses GPLv3.0 code it is likewise licensed under GPLv3.0
